Sixth video:
#How do you find outif the code is true or false....!? 
   use $? if the output of ($?) equals 0, the code is true but if the output of ($?) is not equal 0, the code is false.
Seventh video:
#While....!^
Example:
       var=1
       while [ $var-le 10 ]
       do
           echo $var
           var= $(( $var + 1 ))
           sleep 0.5
       done
 (A variable equal to 1 was created, then using the while rule,
 the count starts until we reach less than 10 or 10, and when it reaches 11, it exits the loop.)
The ninth video:
#For (The same as the while rule, but it differs from it, as it works on each element.)
Example:
       for n in { 1..10 }
       do
           echo $n
           sleep 0.5
       done
Tenth video:
#Make the code more useful.
First, move the code file, for example, to /usr/local/bin
Example:
       sudo mv /usr/local/bin/+name of file .
